## Features

 - Server and client oriented.
 - Internet connection required (IP addr, port number).
 - Nice appearance(coming soon!)...
 - Encryption and decryption(coming soon!).
 - 100% Python code.

## Installation 

Requires Python3.

Dependencies:
 - None so far.. 

- Run `git clone https://github.com/Ebae-b/chatly-reborn-v1.0.0 && cd /chatly-reborn-v1.0.0` to download chatly and cd to the directory.
- To use `chatly` globally, add the repo to your $PATH. Alternatively, add an alias to either of  `Server.py` or `Client.py`, or both- in your `.bashrc` or `.bash_alias`.
- If you are on windows, i'm sorry regarding that..(x_x '), you are on your own...

## Usage

cd to the `/chatly-reborn-v1.0.0/` directory...
Run either:
- `python Client.py -i <ip-of-server> -p <port-number>` for client side.
- `python Server.py -i <your-public-ip> -p <port-number>` for server side.

Runs in a terminal window. GUI not implemented...and will never be (^-^' )..

Run the server side first always.

When running the server side, input the server's IP address and specify a port number.
Then run the client side and connect to communicate using the same IP address and port number used by the server. Wait for connection confirmation, and enjoy!.
